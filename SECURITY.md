## Reporting a vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability with our software or server systems, please report it to us in private. Do not to attempt to harm our users, customer's data or our system's availability when looking for vulneratbilities.

Please contact us at security@pretix.eu with full details and steps to reproduce and allow reasonable time for us to resolve the issue before publishing your findings. If you wish to encrypt your email, you can find our GPG key [here](https://pretix.eu/.well-known/security@pretix.eu.asc).

We're not large enough to run a formal bug bounty program, but if you find a serious vulnerability in our service, we will find a way to show our gratitude.
